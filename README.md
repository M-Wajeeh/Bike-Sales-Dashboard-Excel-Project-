# Bike Sales Dashboard – Excel Project  

## Project Overview  
This project demonstrates how to build a complete **Excel data analysis and dashboard project** from scratch. The dataset contains demographic and behavioral information of potential bike buyers.  

The workflow covers:  
1. **Data Cleaning** – Removing duplicates, fixing categorical values, and creating useful derived columns (e.g., Age Brackets).  
2. **Data Transformation** – Preparing data for analysis using working sheets and pivot tables.  
3. **Dashboard Creation** – Building interactive charts and visualizations with filters and slicers.  

This project can serve as a strong **portfolio piece** for showcasing Excel, data analysis, and dashboarding skills.

## 🗂 Dataset  
The dataset includes the following features:  
- **ID** (unique identifier)  
- **Marital Status** (Married/Single)  
- **Gender** (Male/Female)  
- **Income**  
- **Children**  
- **Education**  
- **Occupation**  
- **Home Ownership**  
- **Cars Owned**  
- **Commute Distance**  
- **Region**  
- **Age**  
- **Bike Purchase** (Yes/No)

## 🔧 Steps in the Project  

### 1. Data Cleaning  
- Removed duplicate rows.  
- Expanded short labels (e.g., `M` → `Married`, `F` → `Female`).  
- Converted categorical inconsistencies (e.g., Yes/No).  
- Created **Age Brackets**:  
  - **Adolescent**: ≤ 30  
  - **Middle Age**: 31–54  
  - **Old**: ≥ 55  

### 2. Pivot Tables & Analysis  
Built pivot tables to analyze key insights:  
- **Average Income by Gender & Bike Purchase**  
- **Commute Distance vs. Bike Purchase**  
- **Age Brackets vs. Bike Purchase**  

### 3. Dashboard Development  
- Designed an **interactive dashboard** with charts and slicers.  
- Key dashboard features:  
  - **Bar Chart** – Income comparison by gender & purchase decision  
  - **Column Chart** – Commute distance distribution of buyers vs. non-buyers  
  - **Line Chart** – Age bracket vs. bike purchase trends  
  - **Slicers/Filters** – Marital Status, Region, Education

## Final Dashboard  
The final dashboard allows users to **filter and explore** data by demographics such as marital status, education, and region while analyzing patterns in **bike purchases**.  

---

## 🚀 Key Learnings  
- Importance of **data cleaning** for reliable insights.  
- How **pivot tables** power dashboards in Excel.  
- Best practices in **dashboard design** (clear visuals, consistent formatting, interactivity).  
- Excel as a practical tool for portfolio-worthy **data analytics projects**.  

---

## 💡 How to Use  
1. Download the Excel file from this repository.  
2. Open it in Excel (preferably latest version).  
3. Use the slicers to filter data and interact with the dashboard.

## ✨ Future Improvements  
- Add additional KPIs (e.g., Cars Owned vs. Purchase, Region-based trends).  
- Integrate with **Power BI** or **Tableau** for advanced visuals.  
- Automate cleaning process using **Power Query** or **Python (Pandas)**.
